# IT Infrastructure Audit Portfolio
Overview
The IT infrastructure audit is conducted to evaluate, secure, and improve the efficiency of an organization's IT systems. This process includes analyzing hardware, software, networks, security, and regulatory compliance.

Scope & Methodology
The audit covers the following key domains:

Inventory Management: Recording and evaluating hardware and software assets.
Performance Metrics: Measuring processing speed, memory usage, storage capacity, and network throughput.
IT Security: Implementing firewalls, encryption, antivirus, and access management.
Configuration Management: Documenting and monitoring network device settings.
Regulatory Compliance: Evaluating adherence to industry standards such as ISO 27001 and GDPR.
Disaster Recovery Procedures: Verifying backups, testing data recovery, and simulating emergency scenarios.
Key Findings & Analysis
IT Asset Inventory: Some devices are not well-documented, causing difficulties in asset management.
Software License Compliance: Some applications lack official licenses, posing legal risks.
Data Security: Access control policies are not optimally enforced, increasing data leakage risks.
Network Connectivity: High latency in certain areas due to suboptimal configurations.
Backup & Disaster Recovery: Data recovery tests show longer recovery times than expected.
Recommendations & Solutions
Improve Inventory Management: Implement an automated system for tracking assets and licenses.
Enhance Security Measures: Adopt multi-factor authentication (MFA), strengthen data encryption, and schedule regular security audits.
Optimize Network Performance: Refine router and firewall configurations for better speed and stability.
Ensure Regulatory Compliance: Update IT policies to align with industry standards and provide security awareness training for staff.
Strengthen Disaster Recovery Procedures: Re-evaluate data recovery tests and implement cloud-based backup solutions for faster recovery.
Impact & Outcomes
Implementing these recommendations has resulted in:
✅ More efficient IT asset management.
✅ Improved compliance with security policies and regulations.
✅ Faster and more stable network performance.
✅ Better data security through stricter access control.
✅ Faster and more effective disaster recovery processes.
